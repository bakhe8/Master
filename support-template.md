### **Question: How do I set up my navigation menus (header/footer)?**

Your theme's menus are controlled by Salla's main menu management system.

1.  From your Salla Dashboard, go to **Store Design** > **Navigation**.
2.  Here you can create and manage your menus. The Beto theme uses the following menu locations:
    *   **Main Menu**: For the primary navigation in the header.
    *   **Footer Menu**: For the "Quick Links" in the footer.
    *   **Top Bar Menu**: For the links in the optional top navigation bar.
