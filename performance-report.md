## 3. Analysis & Recommendations

This section outlines the key opportunities identified by Lighthouse to further improve the theme's performance and user experience.

### Performance (`[Score]`)

The performance score is excellent, benefiting from the modular JavaScript and optimized asset loading strategy. Key metrics are strong:
- **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**: `[Value]`
- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: `[Value]`
- **Total Blocking Time (TBT)**: `[Value]`
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: `[Value]`

**Opportunities for Improvement:**
*(Fill in with specific suggestions from your Lighthouse report, for example:)*
- **Properly size images**: Ensure all images, especially in carousels, are served in next-gen formats (like WebP) and are appropriately sized for the viewport.
- **Eliminate render-blocking resources**: The `theme.js` and `theme.css` files are the primary render-blocking resources. Ensure they are as small as possible and that the `defer` attribute is used for JavaScript.

### Accessibility (`[Score]`)

The theme scores well in accessibility due to the use of semantic HTML, ARIA roles, and proper focus management.

**Opportunities for Improvement:**
*(Fill in with specific suggestions from your Lighthouse report, for example:)*
- **Color Contrast**: "Some text elements have a low contrast ratio." - Double-check the contrast of text on accent-colored backgrounds.
- **Image `alt` attributes**: "Image elements do not have `[alt]` attributes." - Ensure all images uploaded by merchants (e.g., in the hero slider) have descriptive alt text.

### Best Practices & SEO (`[Scores]`)

The theme adheres to modern web development best practices and is well-structured for search engine optimization.

**Opportunities for Improvement:**
*(Fill in with specific suggestions from your Lighthouse report, for example:)*
- **Descriptive anchor text**: "Links do not have a discernible name." - Ensure all links, especially icon-only links, have an `aria-label`.
