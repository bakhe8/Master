     * This function is designed to be used in scenarios where dynamic loading or refreshing of social sharing tools is needed.
     * Ensure that the AddToAny script is properly included in the HTML document before calling this function.

     * // Call the refresh function to initialize AddToAny on the page.

     * @returns {Promise<void>} A promise that resolves once the initialization is complete.
